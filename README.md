Project is completed using javascript<br />
Successfully passed the two test cases shown in the instructions<br />

The project can be compiled with the exact same commands shown in 5b<br />
$ node main.js {your_array} <br />
numbers from the array need to have one space between each of them<br />

Thank you<br />
